###Bounty Bucks:
* Can earn this currency based on what you work on in cclub, for example items of the bounty board.
# You can use these funds to go towards things you would like to see the club buying, to lower the cost.
# This currency will not be used on any concessions
# These can only be used on things that are for the club
# Everyone has a wallet who wants to participate. Club will be the only person who mines on this
